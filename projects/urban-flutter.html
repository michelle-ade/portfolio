          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Urban Flutter is an interactive installation 
            that raises awareness about the effects of 
            light pollution on the Common Birding Butterfly, 
            a protected species in Hong Kong. Developed as 
            part of a group project, the installation uses 
            Raspberry Pis, light sensors, and real-time animation 
            to engage audiences in a meaningful dialogue about 
            sustainability.

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Light pollution is a growing environmental concern, 
            disrupting ecosystems and endangering species like 
            the Common Birdwing Butterfly. The goal was to 
            create an interactive experience that:

            <ul>
              <li>Educates the public about light pollution.</li>
              <li>Encourages audience participation through tangible interactions.</li>
              <li>Highlights the fragility of protected and endangered species.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <hr>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>Urban Flutter allows audience members to interact 
            with the installation using their phone flashlights. 
            Light sensors detect the intensity of the light, 
            adjusting the speed of a butterfly animation in real time. 
            Key features include:</p>

          <p>Real-Time Interaction: Light sensors (LDRs) and 
            Raspberry Pis process input to control the animation.</p>
          <p>Visual Feedback: A butterfly animation speeds up 
            or slows down based on light intensity, symbolising 
            the impact of light pollution.</p>
          <p>Educational Impact: The installation sparks conversations 
            about sustainability and environmental responsibility.</p>
          <hr>

          <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
          <p>Hardware: Raspberry Pis, light sensors (LDRs), and an iPad display</p>
          <p>Software: Python for sensor input processing, 
            the Pygame library for the butterfly animation, 
            and the serial library for managing communication 
            between the Raspberry Pi and the animation.</p>
          <p>Collaboration: Worked in a team of four 
            to integrate the hardware, software and design elements.</p>

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>Urban Flutter was presented to staff and students 
            of the Creative Computing department at HKBU. The project 
            successfully combined technology, art and environmental advocacy 
            to create a memorable and thought-provoking experience.
