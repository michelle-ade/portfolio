          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>Freepaint VR is an interactive virtual reality 
            experience developed for the Meta Quest, 
            designed to provide a creative and therapeutic outlet 
            for children, parents, and carers at the 
            Ronald McDonald House in Kwun Tong, Hong Kong. 
            The project transforms a familiar space into 
            a vibrant canvas, allowing users to paint, mix colours, 
            and express themselves freely. Developed with input 
            from the charity, Freepaint VR prioritises accessibility, 
            intuitive controls, and a joyful, immersive environment.

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Children and families staying at the Ronald McDonald House often face 
            immense emotional and physical challenges due to prolonged 
            hospital visits and treatments. Many children, especially those 
            undergoing cancer treatment, struggle with limited mobility or fatigue. 
            The goal was to create a VR experience that:

            <ul>
              <li>Provides a mess-free, creative space for self-expression.</li>
              <li>Offers intuitive and accessible controls for children with varying physical abilities.</li>
              <li>Encourages exploration and discovery through engaging features.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <hr>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>Freepaint VR combines paint mixing and 3D drawing mechanics 
            in a virtual art gallery filled with familiar characters 
            from Disney and other children's animations. Key features include:</p>

          <p>Paint Mixing: Players can mix colours to create new ones, 
              fostering a sense of discovery and experimentation.</p>
          <p>3D Drawing: Players can draw freely in the space around them, 
              encouraging creativity without constraints.</p>
          <p>Immersive Environment: The virtual art gallery features beloved characters, 
              creating a comforting and engaging space for children of all ages.</p>
          <p>Accessible Controls: The typical motion controller can be paired with 
              directional joystick inputs, ensuring the experience is comfortable 
              for users with limited mobility.</p>
          <hr>

          <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
          <p>Platform: Developed in Unreal Engine 5 using Blueprints</p>
          <p>Painting Mechanics: Spline meshes were used for their intuitiveness. 
            Drawn strokes appear exactly where the player's hand is, 
            eliminating the complexity of calculating angles 
            from spray cans onto surfaces.</p>
          <p>Colour Mixing: Implemented using vector interpolation 
            to blend colours smoothly and realistically.</p>
          <p>Optimisation: Prioritised smooth, responsive controls 
            to ensure a frustration-free experience on the Meta Quest.</p>

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>Freepaint VR was presented to the Ronald McDonald House Charity, 
            where it received positive feedback:

            <ul>
              <li>Engagement: The paint mixing mechanic was praised 
                for its appeal to both younger and older children, 
                offering complexity for those who wanted it while 
                remaining accessible to all.</li>
              <li>Accessibility: The adjustable controls and minimal on-screen text 
                made the experience inclusive for children with varying abilities.</li>
              <li>Therapeutic Value: The immersive environment and familiar characters 
                provided a comforting and joyful escape for families 
                during a challenging time.</li>
            </ul>
