          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>The Steam Review Analyser is a Python-based tool 
            designed to help indie developers, publishers, and marketers 
            gain actionable insights from player feedback on Steam. 
            By extracting review data, organising it into a comprehensive spreadsheet, 
            and performing keyword frequency analysis, this tool streamlines the process 
            of understanding player sentiment and identifying areas for improvement.

          <h2>The Challenge</h2>
          <p>Analysing player feedback manually is time-consuming and often overwhelming, 
            especially for indie developers with limited resources. The goal was to create 
            a tool that:

            <ul>
              <li>Automates the extraction of Steam Reviews.</li>
              <li>Organises data into a user-friendly format (Excel/xlsx).</li>
              <li>Provides actionable insights through keyword frequency analysis.</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <hr>

          <h2>The Solution</h2>
          <p>The Steam Review Analyser extracts review data from Steam, 
            filters it based on criteria like language, playtime, and date range, 
            and organises it into a structured spreadsheet. Key features include:</p>

          <p>Comprehensive Data Extraction: Pulls review text, ratings, playtime, 
            and other metadata.</p>
          <p>Filtering & Sorting: Allows users to focus on specific subsets of reviews.</p>
          <p>Keyword Frequency Analysis: Identifies common themes and issues 
            by analysing the most frequently used words in reviews.</p>
          <p>User-Friendly Output: Generates an Excel file with 
            clear, organised data for easy analysis.</p>
          <hr>

          <h2>Technical Implementation</h2>
          <p>Web Scraping: Used Python's BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries, 
            as well as Steam's API to retrieve review data.</p>
          <p>Data Processing: Leveraged Python's Pandas library 
            to clean, filter and organise the data.</p>
          <p>Keyword Analysis: Implemented a word frequency counter 
            using the Counter class from Python's Collections module.</p>
          <p>Output: Generated Excel files using the openpyxl library.</p>
          <hr>

          <h2>Impact</h2>
          <p>This project is designed to help indie developers and marketers:

            <ul>
              <li>Identify common player complaints and address them in updates.</li>
              <li>Understand what players love about their games to emphasise those features 
                in marketing.</li>
              <li>Save hours of manual work by automating data collection and analysis.</li>
            </ul>

            The tool has been rigorously tested and refined 
            to ensure it meets the needs of its target audience. 
            Its practical applications make it a valuable resource 
            for anyone looking to gain deeper insights into player feedback.
